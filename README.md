Golang HTML5 SSE Example
========================

This is an minimalistic example of how to do
[HTML5 Server Sent Events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events)
with [Go (golang)](http://golang.org/).  From the server's perspective,
SSE is nearly identical to long polling.  The client makes a GET request
that establishes a TCP connection.  The server keeps this connection open
and sends events to the client when they are available. In this example,
the server pushes a new event every five seconds, consisting of a short
message with the current time.  Any number of clients can be
connected: they will all receive the same events if they're connected
concurrently.  (This is achieved using Go's channels and a fan-out
pattern.  In other languages you may need to use some kind of pubsub
messaging, like Redis or Zeromq.)

The main advantage of HTML5 SSE over long polling is that there is a nice
API for it in modern browsers, so that you need not use iframes and such.
SSE is easier than Websockets in the sense that it communicates exclusively
over HTTP and therefore does not require a separate server.  Websockets,
however, supports two-way real-time communication between the client and
the server.

## Installing

Check out the repository from GitHub

	git clone https://github.com/kljensen/golang-html5-sse-example

## Running

To run the server, do 

	go run ./server.go

Then point your web browser to `http://localhost:8000`.
You should see output in the browser like the following:

	Yo friend, here are some fascinating messages about the current time:
	Message: 20 - the time is 2013-03-08 21:08:01.260967 -0500 EST
	Message: 21 - the time is 2013-03-08 21:08:06.262034 -0500 EST
	Message: 22 - the time is 2013-03-08 21:08:11.262608 -0500 EST
	Message: 23 - the time is 2013-03-08 21:08:16.263491 -0500 EST
	Message: 24 - the time is 2013-03-08 21:08:21.264218 -0500 EST
	Message: 25 - the time is 2013-03-08 21:08:26.264433 -0500 EST

And, you should see output in the terminal like the following

	2013/03/15 03:55:55 Sent message 0 
	2013/03/15 03:55:55 Broadcast message to 0 clients
